## LLM-Generated Insights
### 1. The Data You Received:
The dataset comprises various indicators reflecting aspects of well-being and socio-economic conditions. It has a total of 10 features, including:

- **Country name**: The name of the country (not measured quantitatively).
- **Year**: The year corresponding to the data for each country.
- **Life Ladder**: A measurement of subjective well-being (how people feel about their lives).
- **Log GDP per capita**: The natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita, a common economic indicator.
- **Social support**: A measure of perceived support available from family and friends.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: A measure of the perceived freedom individuals believe they have in making life choices.
- **Generosity**: Reflects the extent of charitable donations or support.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: A measure reflecting how corruption is perceived in their country.
- **Positive affect**: A measure of positive emotions felt by individuals.
- **Negative affect**: A measure of negative emotions experienced.

### 2. The Analysis You Carried Out:
The analysis involved several key steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identified missing values in features related to GDP, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and affect.
  
2. **Assessing Distribution**: Evaluated skewness and kurtosis for the numerical features, indicating whether the distributions were normal, skewed, or had heavy tails.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: Computed the correlation matrix among numeric features to ascertain relationships and dependencies among variables.

4. **Identifying Outliers**: Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers in the various features.

### 3. The Insights You Discovered:
Key findings from the analysis include:

- **Missing Values**: Significant missing data in `Generosity` (81), `Perceptions of corruption` (125), and `Healthy life expectancy at birth` (63) may affect the analysis and modeling.
  
- **Skewness**: The data showed skewness in multiple features such as `Social support` and `Healthy life expectancy at birth`, indicating potential non-normal distributions.
  
- **Strong Correlations**: Notably, `Log GDP per capita` has strong positive
